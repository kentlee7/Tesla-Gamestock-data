# Tesla-Gamestop-data
Exercise for IBM Data Science course

This project is a simple data analysis project using Python, for the IBM Data Scientist certificate program, specifically, for the Python Project for Data Science course. I completed this project on 24 July 2024. Due to some problems with the web interface of the Jupyter notebook in the IBM / Coursera course, I used Visual Studio Code on my desktop computer instead. 

The instructions are as follows. 
Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data: Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, you will extract some stock data, you will then display this data in a graph.

Basically, this uses basic webscraping tools from the Python Beautiful Soup and yfinance libraries to download and extract data from tables in HTML files. The BS4 and yfinance Ticker functions were used to download and extract revenue and stock data on Tesla and Gamestock, convert them to dataframes, format them, and then provide graphs, using a graphing function provided in the course materials.
